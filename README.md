Calendar App (Demo Version):

The Calendar App is a tool for users to improve their organization of plans and events. The interface follows a minimalistic style, which appears friendly to the users. The controls and equipment used for creating the project will be described in the following paragraphs:

UI/UX:
Upon starting the application, the user is presented with the current month, year, and its dates. At the bottom, there are buttons to navigate to the previous or next months, as well as combo boxes that allow users to quickly select the desired date. To add events, the user can double-click on the desired date, which opens a window for entering information about the event. After filling the required fields (and optionally other ones), the user can save the data. The saved data then appears on the left side panel, where the main three properties are displayed: name, date, and type. The name is shown in bold font. By clicking on the name, a window opens, displaying more detailed information about the event. Additionally, on the same panel where events are shown, the user can find a button labeled with a red 'X', which, when pressed, removes the event. Finally, at the bottom of the side panel, there are three checkboxes that serve as filters for events. Initially, all checkboxes are checked, and they display events of the selected types. All events are saved even after closing the application.

Tools and Packages:
The project was developed using the .NET framework, specifically with Windows Forms. No other packages were used; it was built solely with pure C#. The project comprises multiple forms and user controls to enhance functionality and organization. Furthermore, every component is properly named and adheres to the style of the rest of the project.

Remarks / Further Improvements:
The app could be further improved by adding additional features such as highlighting the current date, editing already added events, and displaying events directly on the dates. However, while these additions would significantly enhance the project, it is already in a state that is sufficient for use.
